FlashCards are a time tested technique used by students to review and test their knowledge on a particular subject.

This app is based on a knowledge base of questions and answers about a particular subject and randomly displays a card with the question and multiple answers. The objective is for the user to select the correct answer(s).

This project is based off of the [Dev Jam Flash Cards](https://github.com/DevJamGroup/Projects-List/blob/master/Projects/2-Intermediate/FlashCards-App.md) project requirements.
